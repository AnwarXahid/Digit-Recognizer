# Digit-Recognizer
This project is developed to participate Entry level kaggle competition.

Dataset: 
MNIST classic dataset of handwritten images.

Goal:
My goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 


Methodolody:
1. Splited the dataset into train, validation and test dataset.
3. Created a model with 'ReLU' activation function for hidden layer and 'Softmax' for output layer.
2. Trained the model using training data set and validated with validation set and tuned the hyperparameter.
3. Used 'categorical crossentropy' as loss function, 'adam' as optimizer and 'accuracy' as metrics.
4. Got 98% accuracy.
